# Apotheotic Additions
Apotheosis Addon, adding content and cross mod compatibility.

## Additional Rarities
Apotheotic Additions adds in 3 new rarities, Artifact, Heirloom, and Esoteric
- Artifact contains very strong attributes.
- Heirloom is weaker than Artifact attribute wise, but has very strong effects.

There are currently no plans to make Artifact, Heirloom, and Especially Esoteric reforgable through the reforging table.

## Trading
Apotheotic Coins can be found within rogue spawners, or traded with the Wandering Trader.
These can be used to purchase mod specific items. The trades can vary based on what mods are present in the modpack.
## Rogue Spawners
New Rogue Spawners spawn deep underground, containing loot specific to the mod the create that spawns in it is from.
## Enchanting
4 new shelves are added in, requiring Ancient Material in order to craft them.
## Gems
There are a current total of 33 new gems added by this mod. They are known as "Jewels" for namesake, as a majority of them
can be upgraded past Ancient Rarity, and all the way to Esoteric.
Gems added are based on what mods are currently installed, with some gems having crossmod compatability with each other.
To alleviate the grind somewhat for obtaining gem dust, Amethyst Blocks can be salvaged for Gem Dust.
